- **JWT Token Management**: Implemented secure token-based authentication with role information
- **API Route Protection**: Created middleware to verify user roles via `x-user-role` headers
- **Theme Consistency**: Established color-coded themes (Admin: Green, Manager: Blue, Staff: Orange)
- **Component Reusability**: Built role-agnostic components with conditional rendering based on permissions

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// API Route Protection
function isAuthorized(request) {
  const role = request.headers.get('x-user-role');
  return role === 'admin' || role === 'manager' || role === 'staff';
}

// Theme Implementation
const themeColors = {
  admin: 'green',
  manager: 'blue', 
  staff: 'orange'
};
```

### Challenge 2: Real-Time Data Synchronization

} catch (error) {
  await query('ROLLBACK');
  throw error;
}
```

**Code Example**:
```javascript
// Automatic Loan Status Update
async function checkAndUpdateLoanStatus(loanId) {
  const { total_repayments, paid_repayments } = await getRepaymentStats(loanId);
  if (total_repayments > 0 && total_repayments === paid_repayments) {
    await updateLoanStatus(loanId, 'completed');
  }
}
```

const offset = (page - 1) * limit;
const result = await query(`
  SELECT * FROM loans 
  ORDER BY created_at DESC 
  LIMIT $1 OFFSET $2
`, [limit, offset]);
```

### Challenge 6: Data Validation and Error Handling
